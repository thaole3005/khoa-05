                Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, which makes it a piece of cake to build complex responsive interfaces without ever leaving your HTML.
                This works for every utility class in the framework, which means you can change literally anything at a given breakpoint â€” even things like letter spacing or cursor styles.
